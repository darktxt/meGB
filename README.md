This project is a remake of [GameLad](https://github.com/Dooskington/GameLad) and only supports Windows. 

VS, cmake and vcpkg is required.

- `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git` and run `bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`
- modify the `compile.bat` and run it, you will get a vs project.

I will go on coding every week and add aduio support. 

Wish me luck = = !
